Instructions for this exercise
------------------------------

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests.
